**New Feature** · 2026-02-15

Pipeline now supports **waterfall enrichment**: try multiple email finder and enrichment sources in sequence so you get the best coverage without over-spending. Configure order and fallbacks in the dashboard.

### [Mobile approval workflow]({{ site.baseurl }}/changelog/2026-02-mobile-approval/)  
**Improvement** · 2026-02-01

Swipe to approve or reject leads directly from the mobile app. Batch actions and real-time job status make it easier to run the pipeline from your phone—no need to sit at a desk to qualify leads.
